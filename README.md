# Emory-ISOM-352
A collection of assignments I have completed for Emory - Goizueta Business School's course called "Applied Data Analytics with Coding".

This course is an elective, which is part of Goizueta's Information Systems and Operations Management track. The course description describes it as:
   "To solve business problems in various domains including marketing, finance, healthcare and sports, students will develop expertise in coding with Python and build data management skills using SQL. This course will equip students with applied data analysis and practical programming skills that are essential for a career in any data intensive organization, including data ingestion, processing, analysis, and presentation using tools that are in high demand in the industry (e.g., SQL, coding with Python, spreadsheets)."
